# Motor-Failure-Prediction
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook project that processes accelerometer data and tests various machine learning algorithms to predict motor failure time. The project is based on the paper "Prediction of Motor Failure Time Using An Artificial Neural Network" by Gustavo Scalabrini Sampaio et al.
